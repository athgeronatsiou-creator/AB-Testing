Design & Accessibility Rule

When redesigning or generating UI:
- Use a Spotify-inspired, content-first design approach (dark UI, minimal chrome, strong visual hierarchy).
- Use a vibrant peach as the primary accent color, applied sparingly to key actions and highlights.
- Strictly comply with WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility guidelines, including sufficient color contrast, readable typography, visible focus states, keyboard navigation, and non-color-only indicators.
- Accessibility and usability must never be compromised for visual style.
